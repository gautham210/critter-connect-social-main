# Critter Connect 🎯


## Basic Details

### Project Description
Critter Connect is a cozy, chaotic, and utterly unnecessary social media app — but for animals.  
Why should humans have all the algorithmic attention? From barks to meows, we're amplifying voices that only say “moo.” 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Animals everywhere are unable to post their dinner, complain about the rain, or share blurry photos of squirrels.  
Their social lives? In shambles. Their opinions? Unheard. Their drama? Untapped.  

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A full-fledged animal-only social network with:  
- 🐾 A feed full of woofs and chirps  
- 📤 Uploads of paw-traits  
- 📩 Inbox of 100% mock animal chats (just noises)  
- ❤️ Like toggling so dogs feel validated  
- 🎨 All wrapped in a cute Threads-style UI with zero real-world usefulness
